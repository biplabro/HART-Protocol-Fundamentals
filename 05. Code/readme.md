The code sits at the "Protocol Translation" segment of the "Bigger_picture.pfd" IIoT architecture. The aim od the code is to take existing industry 3.0 HART protocol format data received from the sensor interface. See the data, process it, format it & send it to the upstream IoT network for further processing and decision making.

only 2 files are needed to successfully execute the code. "HART_Data.txt" and "data_upstream.py"

HART_Data.txt - includes device responses, compatible with HART 5.0 specifications, short addressing mode
<br> data_upstream.py - the actual python code
<br> Script_Demonstration.m4v - demonstration of the code

data_upstream.bak - backup file, previous iterations
<br> split_check.py - backup file, previous iterations
